# Database configuration

The application connects to MongoDB using two environment variables that should
be set in both local development and deployed environments:

```bash
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>/"
MONGODB_DB_NAME="<database-name>"
```

`MONGODB_URI` provides the connection string for your cluster while
`MONGODB_DB_NAME` specifies the exact database to use. Configure the same values
in your deployment settings and create a local `.env.local` (not committed to
git) so every environment points at the same MongoDB database. If
`MONGODB_DB_NAME` is omitted, the application falls back to the database
encoded in the URI (or MongoDB's default of `test`).

Restart the Next.js server after updating either variable to ensure the new
configuration is loaded.

> ℹ️ The `/api/guide-sponsors` endpoint now **requires** MongoDB. Remove any
> leftover `guide_sponsors.json` files that may have been generated by previous
> local runs using the JSON fallback so that sponsor uploads always read and
> write directly to the `guide_sponsors` collection.
